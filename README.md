<h1>Post-List</h1>


<p>
  I developed a form project with React-Vite using the MVC structure.
This is a post creation project. You may create new posts in this project. You can sort the posts of the user you choose among all the posts in the database or add a new post.
Since it has an easy and understandable interface, it is a flexible project that can be used in many areas and is open to development.</p>
